        We were founded in 2009, and by 2010 we organized our first tie-dye cupcake bake sale, raising money to start empowering girls. By October 2011 we grew as a company and hosted our first Leadership Summit on the UN’s International Day of the Girl. We graduated our first girl in June 2012 and are now expanding our operations into two new countries.<br><br>

        A typical girl going through the Shanti Bhavan program in India comes from a life of poverty. She is admitted at four and is educated through age seventeen. At the end of her education, a girl that has graduated from Shanti Bhavan has the chance to earn a wage 18% higher than a girl that has not received a degree.</h3>

        <h4>President and Founder of She's The First</h4>
        <p>Tammy is the first in her family to graduate from college–she studied journalism at The College of New Jersey, where her final assignment unexpectedly put her on the path to social entrepreneurship. After reporting on a foundation that sponsored children’s education in war-torn Liberia, she felt the urgent need to give girls worldwide access to an education. This was a story she could not walk away from as an unbiased reporter, so she traveled to Liberia and began to volunteer for the cause after graduation.</p>
